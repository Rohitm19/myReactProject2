className: 
An attribute used to specify a CSS class. This applies to all regular DOM and SVG elements like <div>, <a> & others.

Props:
React allows us to pass information to a Component using something called props (stands for properties).
Props are basically kind of global variable or object

useState:
useState is a Hook that allows you to have state variables in functional components. You pass the initial state to this 
function and it returns a variable with the current state value (not necessarily the initial state) and another 
function to update this value.

Props are used to pass data, whereas state is for managing data. Data from props is read-only, and cannot be modified
by a component that is receiving it from outside. State data can be modified by its own component, 
but is private (cannot be accessed from outside).

useEffect:
What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. 
React will remember the function you passed (we'll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing 
the DOM updates.
whatever passed inside useEffect will be run as soon as dom gets loaded. and everytime the page refreshes or anything 
renders on the page useEffect will keep on executing. We can stop the execution to only once by adding an empty aray as 
a second argument. 
  
If you want to return something in REACT use paranthesis '()'. Whatever logic is put inside the () will be return.

e is an event object. e is the event, which in this case is change, target is the element that triggered the event, which in this case is the input, 
and value is the value of the input element

The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string.

A method is an function in an object

'===' this means strictly equal
  keeping track of the state
  expressions passsed into conditions are converted to boolean values 'true' or 'false' by javaScript. if(a=b) --> if(true) or if(false).
  no condtion can be applied to else . to apply any condtion use else if (condition)     

how to link external css to html
  {/* <link rel="stylesheet" href= "url or index.css"></link> */}. rel defines the relation between html and link that is style sheet

everything that is created in css file is the selector

document.queryselector("#sum-el") -- here we have to be more specific with the value we pass into the paranthesis. We use "#" infront of the "sum-el"
  to tell the selector it is actually the id of sum-el that we are looking for because unless the document.getElementById we are not specifying the id 
  in the method name that is querySelector. querry = question or search and selector=css selectors, so we are kind of asking for element by its selector
  and then we specify the selectors inside the "()".
  so it gets the css body and querries the id name mentioned by #. Since it uses css we can replace id by class 
  for eg <p class="sum-el"><p>
  so then we can use document.queryselector(".sum-el"). Replace "#" with ".". orelse we can also say document.queryselector("body"). but using body 
  it will change the entire body elements mentioned.

Arrays
  They are also called as composite/ complex data type. This means array is composed of many datatypes. 
  Where as  boolean, strings and numbers are primitve datatypes which means they not composed of many other data types.
  cards = [1,2]
  newCard = 6 
  cards.push(newCard)// to push a value
  console.log(cards);
  cards.pop()// this will pop out the last array value starting from left. also no need to pass the value here.

for loop
     start       finish     stepsize
for( let i=1;    i<21;       i += 1 ){
  console.log(i)
}

Math.random()
It gives numbers between 0.000 to 0.99999
so Math.random() * 6 gives 0.0000 to 5.999999

Math.floor
it simply removes the decimals
for eg: Math.floor(3.45632) = 3

AND operaor
if(a=true){
  if (b = true)
}
the above code can also be written as 
if( a=true && b=true){
   do something;
} ....here we are using AND operator to replace a nested if statement. 
if( a && b){
   do something;
}
